### Project for Distributed Operating Systems at Warsaw University of Technology (Mathematics and Computer Science department) Winter 2015

## TIMETABLE

2015.11.24 - we will have nodes registering in master and working insert of single row from many clients (no failure detection, no replication etc.)
2015.12.01 - we will be able to insert data with replication with some replication factor + failure of node detection with replicating data it had

2015.12.12 - we will be able to do update, delete and select queries on our data (possible not full failure detection and bugs)

2015.12.15 - we will have working and bug free first version (step 1) of our project we will start working on multiple masters (step 2)

2015.12.22 - we will have „backup master” - master synchronized with main master that can be switched in case of main master failure (backup plan is to end on that if we won’t have time)

2016.01.12 - beta version of multiple masters (can be buggy and we can have some troubles with consistency but is should be working)

2016.01.19 - we will fix as many bugs as possible
